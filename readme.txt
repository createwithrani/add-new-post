Adds an "Add New" button to the Block Editor (Gutenberg) toolbar, so you can easily create new posts/pages/custom post types without leaving Fullscreen Mode in the editor. A kebab menu on the button allows you to duplicate the current post as well.

== Description ==

A razor sharp plugin that does just one thing: allow you to quickly create new posts from the Block Editor toolbar. You can create new posts in one of two ways:

1. Create a brand new empty post.
2. Duplicate the current post.

This brings back the ability to create new posts, pages, custom post types quickly and easily even when you're in Fullscreen Mode in the Editor.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Yes, this plugin is actively supported. If you have a question, issue, or you've identified a bug, please reach out through the support forums.

Right now all _default_ WordPress post information gets duplicated, except featured images. Currently, custom taxonomies, Yoast information, or custom additions are not supported. But as the plugin evolves, more support will be added. Please use the support forums to let us know what you'd like added support for.
= How can I change when QuickPost is available? =
The plugin provides a filter called `QuickPostDisplay` to help you affect QuickPost's visibility. Refer to the example in the [README on GitHub](https://github.com/createwithrani/quickpost/tree/main#filtering-quickpost-visibilitys).

== Changelog ==

= 0.1.5 - Feb 27, 2023 =

* Adds a new keyboard shortcut to create a new post directly from your keyboard (Ctrl + Option + N on Mac or Alt + Shift + N on Windows)

= 0.1.4 - May 10, 2022 =

* Looks like the last release didn't get pushed correctly, so this is a push to actually fix the `common.min.css` problem.

= 0.1.3 - May 6, 2022 =

* FIX: the `common.min.css` file was getting enqueued unnecessarily to the front-end, this fixes that. Thanks for the report [@mrwweb](https://profiles.wordpress.org/mrwweb/)!

= 0.1.2 - May 1, 2022 =

* NEW FEATURE: You can filter the visibilty of the entire QuickPost button using the filter `QuickPost.Display`. QuickPost has a property called `visibilit`y, which you can set to `true` or `false` depending on a condition of your choosing.
* ENHANCEMENT: The `Add New` button into a true semantic link to allow folks to open the new post in the current tab/window, new tab, or new window.
* ENHANCEMENT: When you choose to duplicate a post, on success, not only does the entire menu item transforms into a semantic link (for the same benefits as the `add new` button transformation, but also with the call to action `Edit duplicated {post type label}`, to correctly indicate they'll be taken to the editor for the newly duplicated post.
* FIX: the translations weren't working correctly because of an incorrectly enqueued file, that's been fixed.

= 0.1.1 - February 27, 2022 =
