Adds an "Add New" button to the Block Editor (Gutenberg) toolbar, so you can easily create new posts/pages/custom post types without leaving Fullscreen Mode in the editor. A kebab menu on the button allows you to duplicate the current post as well.
## Description

A razor sharp plugin that does just one thing: allow you to quickly create new posts from the Block Editor toolbar. You can create new posts in one of two ways:

1. Create a brand new empty post.
2. Duplicate the current post.

This brings back the ability to create new posts, pages, custom post types quickly and easily even when you're in Fullscreen Mode in the Editor.

If you enjoy the plugin, please leave a review! ‚≠ê

## Thanks these lovely humans!
This was an odd duck, although relatively easy to make. I truly appreciate people taking time out of their day to test and give me feedback so I could make this tiny but handy plugin great. Major props to @sc0ttkclark, @treadlightly, and @christinaworkman for all their help! üíü
