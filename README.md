![Quick Post Button](https://github.com/createwithrani/add-new-post/blob/main/assets/banner-1544x500.png?raw=true)

Adds an "Add New" button to the Block Editor (Gutenberg) toolbar, so you can easily create new posts/pages/custom post types without leaving Fullscreen Mode in the editor.
## Description

A razor sharp plugin that does just one thing: add an "Add New" button to the Block Editor toolbar, bringing back the ability to create new posts, pages, custom post types quickly and easily even when you're in Fullscreen Mode in the Editor.
